This website was created as part of Assignment 2 to showcase both my personal profile and my ability to design and implement interactive web content. The homepage introduces me, my skills, and my projects in a resume-style format. The visualizations page demonstrates my understanding of SVG and JavaScript.


Technologies Used:

- HTML5 – Semantic structure for homepage and visualizations page.

- CSS3 – Custom styling for a clean, responsive layout across devices.

- JavaScript– Added interactivity (navigation toggle) and generated visualizations (SVG bar chart).

- SVG – Used for drawing and animating custom visualizations directly in the browser.

- GitHub Pages – Used to save files and host the website online.


Instructions to View the Website:

1. Open the GitHub Pages link: (https://aikkizafire.github.io/)
2. Then Explore the Pages:
    - Homepage (index.html) – My introduction, education, skills, projects, and contact.
    - Visualizations (visualizations.html) – Contains a bar chart of weekly gaming hours.
